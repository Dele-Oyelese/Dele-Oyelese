### 👋 Hi there, my name is Dele Oyelese.

I am a Master's of Software Engineering New Graduate open to new work experiences. I am passionate about analytic problem-solving and working within a team. I am looking for the next opportunity to challenge myself and learn new skills. 
In my spare time, I enjoy running 🏃‍♂️, playing rugby 🏉 and writing code 💻

If you have questions for me, please do not hesitate to reach out! :)
